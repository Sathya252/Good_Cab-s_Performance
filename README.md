**City-Level Operational Analytics Dashboard**
**Project Overview**
This project analyzes and visualizes city-level operational data for a transportation and mobility company. The primary objective is to generate actionable insights from data to enhance business performance, track key metrics, and identify trends. The analysis is tailored to address various business needs, such as evaluating trip efficiency, passenger loyalty, and city-level contributions.

**Key Features**
City-Level Fare and Trip Summary:

Aggregates total trips, calculates average fare per kilometer and determines each city's contribution to the overall trip count.
Assesses pricing efficiency and trip volume to guide strategic decision-making.

**Monthly Performance Evaluation:**
Compares actual trips against target trips for each city and month.
Categorizes performance as "Above Target" or "Below Target" with a detailed percentage difference analysis.

**Passenger Loyalty Analysis:**
Tracks the frequency of repeat trips for passengers across cities.
Identifies customer loyalty patterns by analyzing the percentage distribution of passengers based on trip counts.

**Top and Bottom Cities Analysis:**
Identifies the top 3 and bottom 3 cities based on new passenger counts, providing insights into market penetration and growth areas.

**Revenue Insights**
Pinpoints the month with the highest revenue for each city.
Calculates each month's revenue contribution to the city's total revenue.

**Repeat Passenger Rate Trends:**
Analyzes monthly and city-wide repeat passenger rates to evaluate customer retention and loyalty.

**Technologies Used**
**Python:**
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Data Cleaning and Transformation
Processed and cleaned raw datasets with over 500,000 records.
Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and ensured data consistency.
Merged multiple datasets, including city-level details, passenger data, and trip summaries.
Insights and Results
Enhanced Data Visibility: Enabled stakeholders to track real-time performance metrics such as trip volume, revenue, and passenger satisfaction.

**Improved Decision-Making:** Provided actionable insights to improve pricing strategies, identify high-performing cities, and address underperformance.
Automated Reporting: Streamlined data workflows, reducing manual effort by 30% through automated Python scripts.
